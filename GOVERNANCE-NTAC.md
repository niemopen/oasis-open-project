# NIEM Technical Architecture Committee (NTAC) Governance

This document amplifies the [NIEM Open community governance](GOVERNANCE.md) document. It incorporates all provisions of that document. In case of conflict, that parent document controls. This document changes infrequently by the process defined below.

### Responsibilities

The NTAC is responsible for transforming the business requirements of NIEM into the technical architecture of NIEM Open.  This includes:

* All technical specifications
* Conformance of NIEM model artifacts with those technical specifications
* The design (but not the execution) of the NIEM release workflow and artifacts.
* A tool strategy, requirements and desiderata for software tools supporting developers who design NIEM-conforming message specifications and/or implement software that creates or consumes NIEM-conforming messages.
* The adapter, external, and utility schema documents in the XML Schema representation of the NIEM data model.

### Composition

The NTAC must at all times have a chair or two co-chairs. The NTAC chair or co-chairs are appointed by the PGB and serve staggered two-year terms, renewable by the PGB.

We anticipate the PGB will delegate the appointment of other NTAC voting members to the co-chairs.  Nominees for NTAC voting members can be submitted by any individual to the NTAC chairs. Voting members are appointed and serve at the discretion of the NTAC chairs, ordinarily for a 2 year renewable term.

NTAC observers may be admitted to any meeting at the discretion of the NTAC chairs.

### Decisions

For most decisions, the NTAC operates by [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html). The following decisions are made by agreement of the co-chairs:

* Appointment of the NTAC voting member on the PGB [(according to Open Projects Rule 5.1)]().

The NTAC may, at its own discretion, delegate authority on minor technical decisions to Maintainers in the community, including but not limited to:

- Tagging of *minor versions* of a project
- Creation and merging/removal of feature branches
- Acceptance or rejection of specific defects, feature requests, user stories
- Merging of pull requests

Decisions on the following items must be made based on a [Simple Majority Vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dSimpleMajority)

- Tagging / releasing of a new *major version* of a project
- Recommending work to the PGB for promotion to the standards track

## Updating Governance

All substantive changes in Governance require a [full majority vote](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dFullMajority) of the PGB.
